0.17_02   2017-10-14 01:03:04 -0400
  - Fix Windows testing regression introduced in 0.17_01

0.17_01   2017-10-13 15:58:30 -0400
  - Filter out broken and recursive symlinks
  - Better handle symlinked .so files on platforms that support that.

    Previously, we preferred the longer .so names (ie, libfoo.so.1.2.3)
    over the shorter .so names (libfoo.so) since the latter is usually a
    symlink, and the former may have useful "version" information in the
    filename.  That is a problem when a system is using symlinks to indicate
    a preference, (for example, if there are both libfoo.so.1.2.3,
    libfoo.so.1.2.4 and libfoo.so is a symlink to one of those).
    
    Now we still endevour to return the long .so name, but use the short
    name to see which one is preferred by the operating system, or user.
    
    In the absense of any symlinks to disambiguate two libraries with the
    same name, we prefer the one with a newer version number.   That is
    libfoo.so.2.3.4 would be preferred over libfoo.so.1.2.3
   
  - Slightly more consistent diagnostic messages.
  - Added functions: which, where, has_symbols
    None are exported by default, but may be requested.

0.16      2017-08-08 10:24:49 -0400
  - Tentative support for msys

0.15      2016-05-05 19:53:32 -0400

0.14      2015-09-09 08:25:15 -0400

    (0.12 was accidentally removed from CPAN)

0.12      2015-08-06 16:09:32 -0400
  - Switch to MakeMaker since we are not using any features
    that require Module::Build

0.11      2015-02-13 08:45:23 -0500
  - New recursive option
  - The experimental _r option will be keept beiefly then removed
  - The lib option allows '*' to match any library
  - New systempath option

0.10      2015-02-12 18:52:54 -0500
  - Add experimental and undocumented _r option intended for use
    with Alien::Base only.

0.09      2015-01-28 17:10:53 -0500
  - Skip undef found in system library path. (thanks bakkiaraj gh#3)
    On Windows this was causing a undef'd variable warning if %PATH% has a 
    trailing ;

0.08      2015-01-25 04:54:37 -0500
  - Prefer FFI::Platypus in documentation over other FFI systems

0.07      2015-01-16 10:22:22 -0500
  - bugfix: forgot to export find_lib_or_die

0.06      2015-01-13 12:07:19 -0500
  - add function find_lib_or_die

0.05      2015-01-10 17:31:34 -0500
  - add function find_lib_or_exit (GH#2)
  - [API CHANGE] find_lib returns first library
    found if called in scalar context, instead 
    of the number of libraries found.
  - better diagnostics for failure (GH#1)

0.04      2015-01-02 11:21:59 -0500
  - works with .bundle files on OS X
    (previously only with .dylib files)
